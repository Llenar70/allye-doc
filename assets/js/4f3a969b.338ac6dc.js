The dataset contains 64,000 customers who made a purchase within the last 12 months. These customers were part of a randomized email experiment:\\n\\n*   **1/3** received an email featuring **Mens merchandise**.\\n*   **1/3** received an email featuring **Womens merchandise**.\\n*   **1/3** were in the **Control group** (no email).\\n\\nWe have two weeks of tracking data following the campaign to see if these emails actually drove results.\\n\\n### The Attributes\\n\\n\\nHere is a summary of the dataset attributes:\\n\\n| Variable Name          | Description                                                              | Example Values / Notes              |\\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\\n| **Recency**            | Months since last purchase                                               | 1, 4, 12                            |\\n| **History_Segment**    | Categorical buckets for dollars spent in the past year                   | `$0-$100`, `$100-$200`, etc.        |\\n| **History**            | Actual dollar value spent in the past year                               | 76.50, 340.00                       |\\n| **Mens**               | Purchased Mens merchandise in the past year (1/0)                        | 1 = Yes, 0 = No                     |\\n| **Womens**             | Purchased Womens merchandise in the past year (1/0)                      | 1 = Yes, 0 = No                     |\\n| **Zip_Code**           | Customer location type                                                   | Urban, Suburban, Rural              |\\n| **Newbie**             | New customer in the past 12 months (1/0)                                 | 1 = Yes, 0 = No                     |\\n| **Channel**            | Purchase channel in the past year                                        | Web, Phone, Multichannel            |\\n| **Segment**            | Which campaign the customer received                                     | Mens E-Mail, Womens E-Mail, No E-Mail|\\n\\n**Post-campaign outcome variables (tracked in the 2 weeks after the campaign):**\\n\\n| Variable Name   | Description                                                | Example Values            |\\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\\n| **Visit**       | Visited the website in the two weeks after campaign (1/0)  | 1 = Yes, 0 = No           |\\n| **Conversion**  | Purchased merchandise post-campaign (1/0)                  | 1 = Yes, 0 = No           |\\n| **Spend**       | Dollars spent in the two weeks after campaign              | 0.00, 24.99, 140.00       |\\n\\n\\n### The Goal\\nThe challenge poses several questions, but they essentially boil down to this:\\n1.  **Overall Performance**: Did the emails work? Which one was better?\\n2.  **Targeting**: If we could only send emails to the best 10,000 customers, who should they be? Who should we avoid?\\n3.  **The \\"Why\\"**: Can we explain the drivers behind these results?\\n\\nLet\'s see how a causal approach can answer these better than simple averages.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. A/B Testing\\n\\nWe start with the basics. Using the **A/B Test** node for statistical test, we first run a sanity check (A/A Test) to confirm the randomization was valid. Then, we look at the main metrics: **Conversion**, **Visit**, and **Spend**.\\n\\n<p>\\n  <img\\n    src={require(\'./imgs/overallAB.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Overall A/A & A/B Test\\"\\n    style={{ maxHeight: \'80vh\', width: \'100%\', objectFit: \'contain\' }}\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\n#### Results\\n\\n#### Summary of A/B Test Results\\n\\n| Metric      | Group                | Sample Size | Mean / Rate (%) | 95% CI (Mean/Rate)   | Effect \u0394    | Lift (%)   | p-value | Significant |\\n|-------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\\n| **Recency** | Mens E-Mail          | 21,307      | 5.77            | [5.73, 5.82]         | +0.02       | +0.4%      | 0.481   | No          |\\n|             | No E-Mail (Control)  | 21,306      | 5.75            | [5.70, 5.80]         | \u2013           | \u2013          | \u2013       | No          |\\n|             | Womens E-Mail        | 21,387      | 5.77            | [5.72, 5.81]         | +0.02       | +0.3%      | 0.593   | No          |\\n| **History** | Mens E-Mail          | 21,307      | 242.84          | [239.34, 246.33]     | +1.95       | +0.8%      | 0.432   | No          |\\n|             | No E-Mail (Control)  | 21,306      | 240.88          | [237.49, 244.28]     | \u2013           | \u2013          | \u2013       | No          |\\n|             | Womens E-Mail        | 21,387      | 242.54          | [239.11, 245.96]     | +1.65       | +0.7%      | 0.501   | No          |\\n| **Mens**    | Mens E-Mail          | 21,307      | 55.1%           | [54.4%, 55.8%]       | -0.2pp      | -0.4%      | 0.643   | No          |\\n|             | No E-Mail (Control)  | 21,306      | 55.3%           | [54.7%, 56.0%]       | \u2013           | \u2013          | \u2013       | No          |\\n|             | Womens E-Mail        | 21,387      | 54.9%           | [54.2%, 55.6%]       | -0.4pp      | -0.8%      | 0.378   | No          |\\n| **Womens**  | Mens E-Mail          | 21,307      | 55.1%           | [54.5%, 55.8%]       | +0.4pp      | +0.7%      | 0.439   | No          |\\n|             | No E-Mail (Control)  | 21,306      | 54.8%           | [54.1%, 55.4%]       | \u2013           | \u2013          | \u2013       | No          |\\n|             | Womens E-Mail        | 21,387      | 55.0%           | [54.3%, 55.7%]       | +0.2pp      | +0.4%      | 0.616   | No          |\\n| **Newbie**  | Mens E-Mail          | 21,307      | 50.2%           | [49.5%, 50.8%]       | -0.0pp      | -0.1%      | 0.934   | No          |\\n|             | No E-Mail (Control)  | 21,306      | 50.2%           | [49.5%, 50.9%]       | \u2013           | \u2013          | \u2013       | No          |\\n|             | Womens E-Mail        | 21,387      | 50.3%           | [49.7%, 51.0%]       | +0.1pp      | +0.3%      | 0.799   | No          |\\n| **Visit**   | Mens E-Mail          | 21,307      | 18.3%           | [17.8%, 18.8%]       | +7.7pp      | +72.1%     | 0.000   | Yes         |\\n|             | No E-Mail (Control)  | 21,306      | 10.6%           | [10.2%, 11.0%]       | \u2013           | \u2013          | \u2013       | No          |\\n|             | Womens E-Mail        | 21,387      | 15.1%           | [14.7%, 15.6%]       | +4.5pp      | +42.6%     | 0.000   | Yes         |\\n| **Conversion** | Mens E-Mail       | 21,307      | 1.3%            | [1.1%, 1.4%]         | +0.7pp      | +118.8%    | 0.000   | Yes         |\\n|             | No E-Mail (Control)  | 21,306      | 0.6%            | [0.5%, 0.7%]         | \u2013           | \u2013          | \u2013       | No          |\\n|             | Womens E-Mail        | 21,387      | 0.9%            | [0.8%, 1.0%]         | +0.3pp      | +54.3%     | 0.000   | Yes         |\\n| **Spend**   | Mens E-Mail          | 21,307      | 1.42            | [1.18, 1.66]         | +0.77       | +117.9%    | 0.000   | Yes         |\\n|             | No E-Mail (Control)  | 21,306      | 0.65            | [0.50, 0.81]         | \u2013           | \u2013          | \u2013       | No          |\\n|             | Womens E-Mail        | 21,387      | 1.08            | [0.87, 1.28]         | +0.42       | +65.0%     | 0.001   | Yes         |\\n\\n> **Note**: \\"pp\\" means \\"percentage points\\" for difference in rates.\\n\\nNo selection bias and both campaigns drove statistically significant lift across all metrics compared to the control group.

Beyond Averages: Finding the Best (and Worst) Customers\\n\\nThe challenge asks an interesting question:\\n> *If you could only send emails to the **best 10,000** customers, who would they be? Conversely, who would you **suppress**?*\\n\\nThis is where the job of an analyst splits into two equally important paths:\\n1.  **The Algorithmic Path**: Accurately identifying the top/bottom 10k users to maximize ROI.\\n2.  **The Insight Path**: Explaining *why* these users are the best/worst to stakeholders.\\n\\nIn my experience, mastering the *Algorithmic Path* gets you a bigger bonus. On the other hand, Mastering the *Insight Path* gets you trusted and promoted. The former powers the system; the latter powers the strategy.\\n\\n### Step 1: Estimating CATE\\nTo solve the algorithmic part, we can estimate the **Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)** for each user. This tells us the expected lift (or loss) for a specific individual if they receive the email.\\n\\nIn Allye, we can use the **Causal Forest** to predict CATE for `spend`.\\n\\n<p>\\n  <img\\n    src={require(\'./imgs/CATE_prediction.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"CATE Prediction\\"\\n    style={{ maxHeight: \'80vh\', width: \'100%\', objectFit: \'contain\' }}\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nBy sorting customers based on their predicted CATE, we can easily slice the **Top 10k (Best)** and **Bottom 10k (Worst)**.\\n\\n<p>\\n  <img\\n    src={require(\'./imgs/best_customers.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"List Best Customers\\"\\n    style={{ maxHeight: \'80vh\', width: \'100%\', objectFit: \'contain\' }}\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nThis gives us our target list. But we\'re not done yet. We need to understand *who* these people are.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. The \\"Why\\": Analyzing the Drivers\\n\\nNow we move on to the \\"Insight Path.\\" Since we already have CATE predictions for each individual, it makes sense to dig deeper into what drives these effects. Of course, we should keep in mind that predictions have errors, so it\'s important to use these CATE-based insights as a starting point and then carefully validate them with targeted, stratified-A/B testing.\\n\\nWe can use Regression Analysis or Decision Trees to see which features correlate most strongly with a high CATE.\\n\\n### The Mens Campaign: A Success Story\\nFor the Mens campaign, the analysis highlights three key drivers: **History** (past spend), **Recency** (months since last purchase), and **Channel** (Phone vs Web vs Multichannel).\\n\\n<p>\\n  <img\\n    src={require(\'./imgs/CATE_factors.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"CATE Factors\\"\\n    style={{ maxHeight: \'80vh\', width: \'100%\', objectFit: \'contain\' }}\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nThe highest lift comes from users who:\\n*   Are heavy spenders with a solid purchase history\\n*   Made a recent purchase (short time since last purchase)\\n*   Shop through **multiple channels** (Multichannel)\\n\\n<p>\\n  <img\\n    src={require(\'./imgs/segment_AB.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"segment_AB\\"\\n    style={{ maxHeight: \'80vh\', width: \'100%\', objectFit: \'contain\' }}\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nWhen we isolate this segment and re-run the A/B test, the results are staggering. The lift jumps to **+$1.97** (a +584% increase!).\\n\\nConversely, \\"Phone-only\\" customers with low purchase history show almost **no significant lift**. This makes intuitive sense: email is a digital channel. Customers who only buy over the phone may simply not engage with digital marketing.\\n\\n### The Womens Campaign: A Warning Sign\\nThe Womens campaign reveals a more complex\u2014and concerning\u2014story.\\n\\nWhen we analyze the drivers here, **Zip Code** pops up as a significant factor. Specifically, customers in **Suburban** areas reacted differently.\\n\\n<p>\\n  <img\\n    src={require(\'./imgs/women_CATE_factor.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Women CATE Factor\\"\\n    style={{ maxHeight: \'80vh\', width: \'100%\', objectFit: \'contain\' }}\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nDeep diving into the \\"low performance\\" segment (Suburban, Phone channel, Low spend), we find something alarming: **The No-Email group actually outspent the Email group.**\\n\\n<p>\\n  <img\\n    src={require(\'./imgs/women_low_CATE_segment.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Women Low CATE Segment\\"\\n    style={{ maxHeight: \'80vh\', width: \'100%\', objectFit: \'contain\' }}\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nWhile the p-value (0.619) isn\'t definitive, the trend is negative (-$0.12). Even more interestingly, **visits increased, but conversion didn\'t**. This suggests the email drove traffic, but that traffic converted at a much lower rate than usual.\\n\\n<p>\\n  <img\\n    src={require(\'./imgs/women_visit_lift.png\').default}\\n    alt=\\"Women Visit Lift\\"\\n    style={{ maxHeight: \'80vh\', width: \'100%\', objectFit: \'contain\' }}\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nThis could be an important finding that prompts a fundamental review of the company\'s business strategy. Since sending emails actually led to a decrease in purchase amount for this segment, at the very least, emails should absolutely not be sent to them, and we must further investigate the reasons behind this negative impact. If you were the CEO of this company, you would never simply assume that removing this segment from the campaign solves every problem from the perspective of long-term business growth.\\n\\n\\nMany hypotheses come to mind. Since they are Phone-only customers, could this be an older demographic less comfortable with aggressive digital marketing?\\n\\nIf I were leading this analysis, my next step would be to investigate the **churn rate** for this specific segment.\\n*   **Is churn increasing?** This could signal problems with new product lines, competitors stealing market share, or issues with customer service in those regions.\\n*   **Is churn stable but high?** Perhaps the brand image has shifted too far towards men\'s merchandise, alienating this group.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSo, to answer the challenge:\\n\\n1.  **Which campaign is better?** The **Mens Campaign** is the overall winner.\\n2.  **Who should we target?** We can use a Causal Forest model to predict CATE for both campaigns and target users with the highest expected lift.\\n3.  **Who should we avoid?** We must strictly avoid the \\"Suburban / Phone-only / Low Spend\\" segment for the Womens campaign, as the email appears to destroy value there.\\n4.  **How to Improve?**\\n\\n    Based on our findings, here are three concrete ideas for the next iteration:\\n\\n    *   **Personalize Timing:** Since customers who purchased recently showed the higher CATE, we can personalize the *timing* of the campaign. Triggering emails shortly after a purchase\u2014rather than waiting for a batch campaign\u2014could capture this high engagement window.\\n    *   **Rethink the Channel:** For \\"Phone-only\\" users, digital channels like email clearly aren\'t landing. We should test analog approaches that align with their behavior, such as **direct mail (flyers)** or **phone calls**.\\n    *   **Dig Deeper with Surveys:** For the \\"Suburban / Phone-only / Low Spend\\" segment where we saw a negative impact, we need to go beyond behavioral data.

We are Sho and Nao, the founders of Allye. We are incredibly excited to announce the release of Allye, the ideal product we\'ve always envisioned, built with the power of Generative AI.\\n\\n### Why we built Allye\\n\\nWith over 15 years of experience in Data Science, we\u2019ve seen the landscape evolve. Data Science knowledge is now essential not just for specialists, but also for Product Managers, Marketers, and Engineers.\\n\\nMeanwhile, business and research landscapes are becoming increasingly complex and personalized. As tasks multiply and the demand for efficiency grows, the time available for deep analysis shrinks. Additionally, with the widespread use of AI, the risk of data leakage is rising, making secure data handling more critical than ever.\\n\\nYet, the pressure to make correct, data-driven decisions remains high. We constantly need to \\"understand users,\\" \\"measure effects,\\" and \\"find strategies,\\" but are often buried in operational tasks.\\n\\n### What makes Allye unique\\n\\nWe built Allye to solve this dilemma. It is distinct from other no-code tools:\\n\\n1.  **Obsession with Speed:** Allye is optimized to process practical data sizes instantly. Speed is our UX promise.\\n2.  **Deep Integration with Python:** No-code is fast, but code is flexible. Allye bridges the gap\u2014the AI writes the Python code for you.\\n3.  **Comprehensive Causal Inference:** Understanding \\"why\\" is crucial for business decisions. That is why causal inference is our core analytics engine.\\n4.  **Local & Secure:** Allye runs locally and offline. Your data stays on your device, so you never have to worry about data leakage to AI.\\n\\nAllye Base is free.
