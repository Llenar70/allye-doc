Hello! We are Sho and Nao, the founders of Allye. We are incredibly excited to announce the release of Allye, the ideal product we've always envisioned, built with the power of Generative AI.

### Why we built Allye

With over 15 years of experience in Data Science, we’ve seen the landscape evolve. Data Science knowledge is now essential not just for specialists, but also for Product Managers, Marketers, and Engineers.

Meanwhile, business and research landscapes are becoming increasingly complex and personalized. As tasks multiply and the demand for efficiency grows, the time available for deep analysis shrinks. Additionally, with the widespread use of AI, the risk of data leakage is rising, making secure data handling more critical than ever.

Yet, the pressure to make correct, data-driven decisions remains high. We constantly need to "understand users," "measure effects," and "find strategies," but are often buried in operational tasks.

### What makes Allye unique

We built Allye to solve this dilemma. It is distinct from other no-code tools:

1.  **Obsession with Speed:** Allye is optimized to process practical data sizes instantly. Speed is our UX promise.
2.  **Deep Integration with Python:** No-code is fast, but code is flexible. Allye bridges the gap—the AI writes the Python code for you.
3.  **Comprehensive Causal Inference:** Understanding "why" is crucial for business decisions. That is why causal inference is our core analytics engine.
4.  **Local & Secure:** Allye runs locally and offline. Your data stays on your device, so you never have to worry about data leakage to AI.

Allye Base is free. Check the [Quick Start](https://llenar70.github.io/allye-doc/docs/get-started/allye-quickstart-for-engineers) and start your journey now.
