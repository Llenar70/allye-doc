# Overview

This handson tutorial shows how combining Allye’s widgets unlocks far more than you imagined—deep, powerful analysis that stays fast and practical.

Working with sample datasets, we will dive into five real-world domains that data scientist / AI engineers tackle every day. You can see how Allye turns complex workflows into confident, repeatable practice.


## Template Workflows

The data and workflows covered in this tutorial can be found in the "Template Workflow" section and easily added to your canvas.

_Imagine you're a marketer who launched a newsletter. While it's a great tool for engagement, you're aware that sending it too frequently can bother users and harm the overall experience. You see that subscribers tend to buy more products, but you can't be sure if the newsletter is *causing* this increase. Is it driving sales, or just annoying your customers and leading to opt-outs? This is a classic problem that arises from using **observational data**._
