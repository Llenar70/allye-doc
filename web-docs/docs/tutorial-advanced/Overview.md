# Overview

This advanced tutorial shows how combining Allye’s widgets unlocks far more than you imagined—deep, powerful analysis that stays fast and practical.

Working with sample datasets, we will dive into five real-world domains that analysts tackle every day, so you can see how Allye turns complex workflows into confident, repeatable practice.


## Template Workflows

The data and workflows covered in this tutorial can be found in the "Template Workflow" section and easily added to your canvas.

### 1. A/B test result analysis

_Your A/B test for the new product feature has concluded. Let’s evaluate the impact, dive into the results, and shape the next strategy._

 * Hypothesis Testing - AA Test & AB Test.
 * CUPED
 * Stratification & Clustering
 * Causal Inference - Estimate Individual Effect.

### 2. Exploratory data analysis

_Due to a system issue, there is a possibility that interest rates were incorrectly assigned for some customers. We need to identify which customers were affected and calculate the correct interest rate for each of them._

 * Data Manipulation & Visualization
 * Regression Analysis
 * Connected Visualization

### 3. Quasi-experimental analysis & Causal Inference

_You are evaluating a new hypertension management program, but a randomized controlled trial was not feasible due to operational constraints. As a result, patients were assigned non-randomly, raising concerns about selection bias. Your task is to estimate the program’s effect._

 * Propensity Score Matching

### 4. Machine learning predictive model prototyping

_Optimizing business processes through prediction is extremely powerful and can lead to dramatic gains in efficiency. The best way to build strong models is through rapid prototyping and iterative trial-and-error._

 * Train / Test Data Split
 * Preprocessing Pipeline
 * ML Learner
 * Cross Validation & Evaluation

### 5. AI-driven analytics

_For your detective work, AI is an exceptionally capable partner. Whenever you get stuck in your analysis, let it assist you. Explore what AI can do._

 * Agent Settings
 * Generate Python Code
 * Interpret Result
 * Custom Notebook
