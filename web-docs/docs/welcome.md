**Powered by Open Source**: Allye is built upon the robust foundation of [Orange Data Mining](https://github.com/biolab/orange3), enhanced with our proprietary AI technologies.


# Concept: From "What" to "Why"


Data analysis typically evolves in two stages: first, grasping the current state (the "What"), and second, understanding the underlying causes (the "Why").

For the former, BI tools like Spread Sheet, Looker, and Tableau are excellent. They allow anyone to visualize "what is happening" with minimal friction.

However, moving to the "Why" is significantly harder. Simple aggregation can hide dangerous traps such as multicollinearity, confounding variables, and selection bias. Avoiding these pitfalls requires statistical methodologies that are often complex to implement.

Allye is designed to bridge this gap. It elevates your analysis to the next level, enabling you to uncover causal relationships and deep structures without getting lost in technical complexity.


### 1. Focus on Analysis, Not Code
At the forefront of data science, Python and R are powerful but complex. Often, your time and focus are consumed by coding and debugging rather than the analysis itself.
Allye removes this barrier. Visualization, data processing, and modeling are completed in seconds with a few clicks. This allows you to stay in the flow of critical thinking, turning "detective work" into a smooth, noise-free process.

### 2. Interactive & Interconnected
Insight comes from connecting the dots—linking your hypotheses to facts. Allye’s visualization engine reflects this by keeping your data fully connected.
The interface links every scatter plot, histogram, and data table. Selecting a data point in one view instantly highlights it across all others, revealing high-dimensional relationships and hidden structures at a glance.

### 3. Automated Rigor

Allye produces more than just models; it delivers comprehensive, statistically sound reports.
For instance, to prevent common errors like multicollinearity in regression analysis, Allye automatically calculates VIFs and p-values, highlighting anomalies in red. This built-in safety net ensures your analysis is not only fast but accurate.

### 4. AI Agent

When data preparation becomes too complex for standard widgets, or when you need guidance on advanced methods, Allye’s AI Agent is there to help.
The Agent can generate and execute code, automatically build workflows, and even interpret results for you. It serves as an intelligent partner, supporting you whenever you hit a roadblock.
