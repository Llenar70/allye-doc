# Allye Documentation

Allye is an AI-powered analysis tool that understands your data and helps you analyze data faster through natural language. 
Just describe what you want to analyze and Allye will generate the workflow for you.

Acknowledgment: Allye is built by combining the open-source [Orange Data Mining](https://github.com/biolab/orange3) tool with our own product.

# Concept

When someone feels the urge to analyze data, there are always two sequential desires: first an interest in the "what"—wanting to grasp the current state—and then an interest in the "why" behind it—wanting to understand structures and causal relationships.

For the former, there are great BI tools such as Excel, Google Sheets, Looker, and Tableau, and they require little knowledge (just knowing terms like "mean" or "variance"), so anyone can now uncover the "what."

Yet even though people naturally become curious about the "why" after the "what," the latter is much harder. Simple aggregation hides many traps (multicollinearity, confounding, selection bias, etc.).
What pitfalls exist? How can they be avoided? Disciplines like statistics and causal inference systematize methodologies for approaching the "why," and many techniques have been researched and proposed. Many of them are practiced at the forefront of data science in technology companies and are delivering remarkable results.

Allye is a tool created to elevate your desire to analyze data into that second stage and to embrace your sense of wonder.

### Don't code, Analyze
At the front lines of data science, programming languages like Python and R are used to wield advanced analytical methods.
Their flexibility is powerful, but because of their complexity, your focus and time often get consumed by coding itself rather than by the analysis, and your analysis does not deepen.
When your analytical thinking, critical thinking, and hypothesis thinking are in the zone, coding and syntax errors are just noise.
In Allye, visualization, data processing, and modeling finish in a few clicks and seconds, reducing noise and powerfully accelerating your detective work.

### Connected & Interactive
Detective work is connecting the dots — your hypotheses, the facts, and the ideas they spark — into one coherent line of reasoning. That’s why your data and your charts must connect, too.
We have further strengthened the interactive visualizations that Orange Data Mining offered.
The Visualize Connector links every scatter plot, histogram, and data table, letting you grasp relationships in high-dimensional data at a glance and revealing structures that were previously hidden.


### Comprehensive

In Allye, analysis is not just about building models; comprehensive reports are produced. For example, a typical pitfall in regression analysis is multicollinearity, but Allye not only performs modeling—it also calculates VIFs and p-values and highlights anomalies in red. This enables accurate analysis without missing details.


### Agent

When data preparation or visualization becomes complex and Allye's existing widgets cannot handle it, you are unsure how to use them, or you do not know how to configure methods when you are not familiar with them, rely on AI. The Agent can generate and run code, automatically generate workflows, and interpret results and report findings to support you.
