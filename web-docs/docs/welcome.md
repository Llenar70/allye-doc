# Concept: From "What" to "Why"

Data analysis typically evolves in two stages: first, grasping the current (the "What"), and second, understanding the underlying causes (the "Why").

For the former, BI tools like Spread Sheet are excellent. They allow anyone to visualize "what is happening" with minimal friction.

However, moving to the "Why" is significantly harder. Simple aggregation can hide dangerous traps such as multicollinearity, confounding variables, and selection bias. 

Allye is designed to bridge this gap. It elevates your analysis to the next level, enabling you to uncover causal relationships and deep structures without getting lost in technical complexity.

### 1. Faster!
Visualization, data processing, and modeling are completed in seconds with a few clicks. This allows you to stay in the flow of critical thinking, turning "detective work" into a smooth, noise-free process.

**[> Explore Quickstart](./get-started/Quickstart.md)**

### 2. The Power of Code, The Simplicity of No-Code.
Analysts can build visual workflows and drop into a Notebook node, where **AI generates the necessary Python code** for complex transformations. Conversely, engineers can start in a **JupyterLab**, then seamlessly push data to the Canvas to generate comprehensive reports. It is a unified environment where flexibility meets efficiency.

**[> Explore Unified Environment](./get-started/Unified_Environment.md)**


### 3. Interactive & Interconnected
Insight comes from connecting the dots—linking your hypotheses to facts. Allye’s visualization engine reflects this by keeping your data fully connected.

**[> Explore Connected Visualization](./get-started/Connected_Visualization.md)**


### 4. Automated Rigor
Allye delivers comprehensive, statistically sound reports.

**Powered by Open Source**: Allye is built upon the robust foundation of [Orange Data Mining](https://github.com/biolab/orange3) (and other various oss), enhanced with our proprietary AI technologies.
